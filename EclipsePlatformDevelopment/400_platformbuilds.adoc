== Creating a custom Eclipse IDE build


=== Building the Eclipse IDE

(((Eclipse IDE build)))
Eclipse uses a Maven based build system for automated builds using the Maven Tycho plug-in. 
Using this build system, you can create your custom build of the Eclipse IDE. 
This approach allows you to add and tests patches based on the latest developments of the Eclipse team.
The results of the build are archive files for the different platforms, which include everything to run an Eclipse IDE.

The build procedure might change over time.
See https://wiki.eclipse.org/Platform-releng/Platform_Build[Platform build wiki] for additional information.

=== Requirements
The build of the Eclipse IDE takes around 2 hours on a Core i5 machine with SSD.
Approximately 25 GB of free space and 4 GB of RAM are required on the hardware-side.
Building of an Eclipse IDE is possible on Windows, OS X and Linux based distributions. 
The following description is based on  Linux.

On the software-side the following software is required:

* Git
* Maven Version 3.3.1
* Oracle 1.8 JDK or higher


=== Build instructions

Perform the following instructions to build the Eclipse IDE.

[source,console]
----
git clone -b master 
   --recursive git://git.eclipse.org/gitroot/platform/eclipse.platform.releng.aggregator.git
mvn clean verify -fae
----

Alternatively, to the aggregated comment for cloning, you can also split the commands:

[source,console]
----
git clone git://git.eclipse.org/gitroot/platform/eclipse.platform.releng.aggregator.git
git submodule init
git checkout master
git pull --recurse-submodules
git submodule update
mvn clean verify -fae
----

At the moment the build process generates "dirt", e.g., it generates files which influence the next build.
To ensure that the repository is reseted to a clean state, you can use the following commands.

[source,console]
----
git submodule foreach git clean -f -d -x
git submodule foreach git reset --hard HEAD
git clean -f -d -x
git reset --hard HEAD
----


[TIP]
====
To skip the tests use `mvn clean verify -DskipTests=true -fae`
====

If you receive `java.lang.OutOfMemoryError` error during the Maven build, you should increase the memory which is available for the build.

[source,console]
----
export MAVEN_OPTS="-Xmx2048m"
----


If the build is successful, the Eclipse SDK is packaged as archive files for all supported platforms. 
These packages can be found in the Git repository in the eclipse.platform.releng.tychoeclipsebuilder/sdk/target/products/* folder:



=== Additional infos about building the Eclipse platform


==== Eclipse platform Hudson builds

The Eclipse platform builds at Hudson. 
See https://hudson.eclipse.org/releng/[Releng builds] and https://hudson.eclipse.org/platform/[Platform builds].
This releng build instance is used for the Eclipse SDK build, and the platform instance to validate Gerrit contributions.



==== Changing build ID

A normal CBI Build shows, "Build id: @build@" in the "About Eclipse SDK" window. 
To define a custom build id use the `buildId` parameter and the `update-branding-plugins` profile.


[source,console]
----
include::res/extras/buildid.txt[]
----

[TIP]
====
To check which properties can be overridden check the properties fields in the eclipse-platform-parent/pom.xml file.
====

==== Build single parts of the aggregator

It is also possible to build just single parts of the aggregator repository, by passing the `build-individual-bundles` profile.
The following example shows how to build just the rt.equinox.framework.

[source,console]
----
include::res/extras/build-individual-bundles.txt[]
----


[NOTE]
====
Unfortunately while there are numerous bundles for which the build succeed with this method, there are a couple bundles / features that cannot be built using this method.
====



==== Building natives (SWT binary files)

The CBI build does not build natives by default (SWT binary files).
Instead, the CBI build simply copies pre-built native files from the swt.binaries repository.


For Windows/Mac/Linux it is possible to force the CBI build to build these natives by passing the -Dnative pointing to the build.
For example the _-Dnative=gtk.linux.x86_64_ parameter in the case of Linux. 
List of options available at https://wiki.eclipse.org/Platform-releng/Platform_Build#Building_natives[Building natives].


The Fedora project has removed some non Eclipse IDE related plug-ins to speed up the build process. 
See the http://pkgs.fedoraproject.org/cgit/eclipse.git/tree/eclipse.spec#n366[Fedora build script].
