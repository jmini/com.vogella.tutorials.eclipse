== Using extension points to define JDT templates

You can also define your templates within an Eclipse plug-in.

This makes it easier to distribute your templates to other developers.
	
	
Providing a template can be done via an extension to the `org.eclipse.ui.editors.templates` extension point.
	
The templates are activated for a certain scope. 
For example, you have templates for statements within a method or templates for new methods.


.Context in the template
[cols="1,3",options="header"]
|===
| Statement | Description
| java-statements
| Templates which are available within a method
| java-members
| Allows to define templates for members, e.g., new methods
|===

To provide a code template based on this extension point, create a new plug-in called `com.vogella.jdt.templates`.
	
	
Add an extension for the `org.eclipse.ui.editors.templates` extension point and add an `include` as in the following screenshot.

In the reference file you can add your templates following a predefined schema. 
The file can look like the following, the structure should be easily to adjust for other use cases.

[source, xml]
----
include::res/templates/additional-templates.xml[]
