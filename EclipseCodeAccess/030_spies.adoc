== Identifying who contributes user interface components

=== Plug-in Spy for UI parts

You can activate the _Plug-in Spy_ by pressing kbd:[Alt + Shift + F1] in the Eclipse IDE.
It gives you information about the currently selected user interface component.
This way you can get immediate access to the plug-in which is currently running.

For example, if you click on the _contributing plug-in_ the tool opens the manifest editor for this plug-in.

=== SWT Spy

_SWT Spy_ for Eclipse is a tool that prints out information about the widget under the cursor.
Currently, this includes style, layout and parent information.
See http://www.eclipse.org/swt/tools.php[SWT Development Tools homepage] for more information.

=== Layout Spy

With Eclipse 4.7 PDE has added the SWT Layout Spy.
Press kbd:[Ctrl + Alt + Shift + F9] on any window to activate it.

Press `Select Control` to pick a control to inspect.
With `Show Overlay` you activate an overlay that shows an outline around the selected control (red rectangle) and its child (yellow rectangle).
You can navigate the controls with `Open Child` and `Open Parent`.

To find a control which boundary is misaligned now navigate to a control thats outline is correct but its child isn't.
Check the value of computeSize. If the result of computeSize is correct, the problem is in the parent layout or its attributes. Otherwise the problem is in the child widget.

=== Debugging GTK elements with GtkInspector

`GtkInspector` is a tool that allows you to debug GTK+ applications.
It was introduced in GTK+ 3.14.
To start Eclipse with the GtkInspector start it with an environment variable set.

[source, terminal]
----
GTK_DEBUG=interactive ./eclipse
----

You can also start the GtkInspector for an already running program.
To do this you have to enable the inspector key bindings.
Under ubuntu you might have to install an additional package to make this option available.

[source, terminal]
----
sudo apt-get install libgtk-3-dev
----

Run this command in your terminal to activate the setting.

[source, terminal]
----
gsettings set org.gtk.Settings.Debug enable-inspector-keybinding true
----

After this the keybinding are activated.
